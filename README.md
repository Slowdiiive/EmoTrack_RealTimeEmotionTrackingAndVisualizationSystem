# EmoTrack-RealTimeEmotionTrackingAndVisualizationSystem
Human emotions and moods change rapidly, and subtle shifts are often difficult to capture. For persons, it is challenging not only to accurately describe their own feelings but also to record fleeting emotional moments. If users are required to manually input their emotions into devices through traditional methods, the process may introduce bias. Current technological devices, such as the Apple Watch, can display indicators like stress levels and heart rate to reflect users' emotions. However, these measurements are largely passive and struggle to capture nuanced, moment-to-moment emotional changes. Based on this gap, I propose designing a wearable device that can record usersâ€™ real-time emotions and dynamically present them on digital platforms such as phones or laptops. This system would allow users to better track their emotional fluctuations and pay more attention to their mental health. <br>My initial design idea is to use a dynamic screen effect, where the dominant mood is represented through theme colors. As different emotions emerge throughout the day, their corresponding colors are gradually added to the display, creating a flowing visual timeline of emotional changes. The display flows horizontally, with special visual effects applied at points where emotions change rapidly.
